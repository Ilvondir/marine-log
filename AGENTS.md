# Repository Guidelines

MarineLog is a Laravel 13 application for wildlife observations. Product scope is in `@context/foundation/prd.md`; stack decisions are in `@context/foundation/tech-stack.md`.

## Critical Rules

- Keep work inside the PRD's MVP; its `Non-Goals` are binding.
- Run PHP, Artisan, Composer, and tests through Laravel Sail once Docker is available. Do not rely on host PHP extensions or versions.
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, uploaded media, `vendor/`, or `node_modules/`. Add reusable defaults without secrets to `@.env.example`.
- Never edit `vendor/`; change application code or Composer constraints.
- Preserve `context/`; it contains the product decisions and bootstrap audit trail.
- Keep controllers thin: validate the request, call one service method, and return the response. Do not place persistence or business workflows in controllers.

## Common Commands

- `./vendor/bin/sail up -d` starts Laravel, MySQL, and Redis.
- `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate` applies migrations.
- `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` starts Vite.
- `./vendor/bin/sail composer test` runs tests.
- `./vendor/bin/sail pint --test` checks formatting; `./vendor/bin/sail pint` fixes it.

## Project Structure

Keep schema changes in `database/migrations` and Sail services in `@compose.yaml`. Avoid new top-level directories unless required by the architecture below.

## Architecture

- Put business workflows in `app/Services`; expose intention-revealing methods such as `publishObservation(...)`, not generic CRUD wrappers.
- Define repository interfaces in `app/Contracts/Repositories` and implementations in `app/Repositories`. Repositories own Eloquent queries and persistence; services depend only on their contracts.
- Bind each repository contract to its implementation in `@app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`.
- Inject services and repository contracts through constructors. Do not resolve application dependencies with `app()` or instantiate repositories inside controllers and services.
- Keep services independent of HTTP objects. Pass validated values or typed data objects.
- Repository exceptions must be logged before rethrowing with context keys `repository`, `method`, `operation`, `entity_id`, `exception`, and `message`. Never log secrets or payloads, swallow failures, or return `null` as an error signal.
- Add unit tests for service behavior using mocked repository contracts, and feature tests for complete HTTP and database flows.

## Code Style

Follow `@.editorconfig`, use typed signatures and return types, and match the model metadata pattern in `@app/Models/User.php`. Format PHP with Pint.

## Testing

Use the suites and source scope defined in `@phpunit.xml`. Name methods `test_<behavior>(): void`. Add or update tests for every behavioral change; run a focused test with `./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --filter=<name>`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
