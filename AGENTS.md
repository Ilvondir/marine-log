# Repository Guidelines

MarineLog is a Laravel 13 application for wildlife observations. Product scope is in `@context/foundation/prd.md`; stack decisions are in `@context/foundation/tech-stack.md`.

## Critical Rules

- Keep work inside the PRD's MVP; its `Non-Goals` are binding.
- Run PHP, Artisan, Composer, and tests through Laravel Sail once Docker is available. Do not rely on host PHP extensions or versions.
- Never commit `.env`, credentials, uploaded media, `vendor/`, or `node_modules/`. Add reusable defaults without secrets to `@.env.example`.
- Never edit `vendor/`; change application code or Composer constraints.
- Preserve `context/`; it contains the product decisions and bootstrap audit trail.
- Keep controllers thin: validate the request, call one service method, and return the response. Do not place persistence or business workflows in controllers.

## Common Commands

- `./vendor/bin/sail up -d` starts Laravel, MySQL, and Redis.
- `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate` applies migrations.
- `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev` starts Vite.
- `./vendor/bin/sail composer test` runs tests.
- `./vendor/bin/sail pint --test` checks formatting; `./vendor/bin/sail pint` fixes it.

## Project Structure

Keep schema changes in `database/migrations` and Sail services in `@compose.yaml`. Avoid new top-level directories unless required by the architecture below.

## Architecture

- Put business workflows in `app/Services`; expose intention-revealing methods such as `publishObservation(...)`, not generic CRUD wrappers.
- Define repository interfaces in `app/Contracts/Repositories` and implementations in `app/Repositories`. Repositories own Eloquent queries and persistence; services depend only on their contracts.
- Bind each repository contract to its implementation in `@app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`.
- Inject services and repository contracts through constructors. Do not resolve application dependencies with `app()` or instantiate repositories inside controllers and services.
- Keep services independent of HTTP objects. Pass validated values or typed data objects.
- Repository exceptions must be logged before rethrowing with context keys `repository`, `method`, `operation`, `entity_id`, `exception`, and `message`. Never log secrets or payloads, swallow failures, or return `null` as an error signal.
- Add unit tests for service behavior using mocked repository contracts, and feature tests for complete HTTP and database flows.

## Code Style

Follow `@.editorconfig`, use typed signatures and return types, and match the model metadata pattern in `@app/Models/User.php`. Format PHP with Pint.

## Testing

Use the suites and source scope defined in `@phpunit.xml`. Name methods `test_<behavior>(): void`. Add or update tests for every behavioral change; run a focused test with `./vendor/bin/sail artisan test --filter=<name>`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
